# godaddy_dns-add

This is a really easy to use CLI tool for creating DNS record additions with GoDaddy. 

I will probably expand it as time goes on.

## Installation
1.  Move the godaddy_add-dns executable to your PATH in your shell environment.
2.  Move the godaddy-api.ini file to the /home/$(whoami)/.config directory.
3.  Follow the instructions in godaddy-api.ini to retrieve and populate your API key and secret.
